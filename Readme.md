# Predicting English Premier League Games with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict results of English premier league games in the 2021/2022 season using machine learning techniques.

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to leverage the use of a non-linear classification algorithm called the `RandomForestClassifier`. We want to use this classification algorithm to clissify the games each team will win vs the ones they will lose. We also aim to tune the model's hyperparameters and feature engineer the dataset to improve it's accuracy.

#### Tools
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

#### Outcomes
We learned that accurately predicting football matches can be quite challenging. However we were able to leverage techniques such as cross-validation, precision score and some feature engineering to improve the accuracy of the model from 61.2% to 67.5%.
